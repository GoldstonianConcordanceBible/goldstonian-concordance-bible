# Goldstonian Doctrine — Rule Card

## Mirror → Water → Fire
- Mirror: self-examination before God; truth without excuses.
- Water: cleansing + repair; washing the mind/heart in the Word.
- Fire: courageous obedience; justice + mercy enacted in the world.

## Covenant as Legal Love
Covenant is love with structure: promises, boundaries, protection, accountability.

## Be the Shepherd Gates
Protect, repair, feed, guide—mercy without naivety.

## Justice / Mercy Balance
Justice without mercy becomes cruelty.
Mercy without justice becomes enabling.
